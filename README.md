PopGen
=======

The PopGen.JS module can be used to generate popups on-demand, wether they are messages to the user, forms or prompts. 

Created popups include default events for destroying, waiting in the background, sending data to the server or showing messages.

This library was made to help me declutter my views and reducing the server load by eliminating the need to download simple forms.

Wrapped with almond, so you can use it with or without an AMD loader.
